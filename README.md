# COVID-19 Hospitalisation and Temperature Analysis

## Project Overview

This project delves into the intricate relationships between hospitalisation rates, temperature fluctuations, and demographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spanning the years 2019 to 2021, it aims to uncover how environmental factors and age demographics correlate with the progression of the pandemic.

## Objectives

	•	To identify key trends and seasonal fluctuations in hospitalisation rates.
	•	To investigate the impact of temperature variations on hospitalisation rates.
	•	To explore the correlation between intensive care admissions, mortality rates, and age demographics.
	•	To utilise statistical techniques and visual data representations to analyse and present findings.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on three primary datasets:

	1.	Hospitalisations: Detailed records of COVID-19 hospitalisations, including intensive care admissions and mortality rates.
	2.	Population Demographics: Information on age group distributions within various departments and regions.
	3.	Temperature Records: Daily average, minimum, and maximum temperatures by department.

## Methodology

	•	Data Integration: The datasets were merged to facilitate a comprehensive analysis.
	•	Statistical Analysis: Employed Pearson correlation coefficients, linear regression models, and time series analysis to explore relationships between variables.
	•	Visualisation: Graphs and heatmaps were generated to visually represent the analysis results.

## Findings

The analysis revealed significant insights into how temperature variations and demographic factors influenced hospitalisation rates. Specific findings include:

	•	Seasonal patterns in hospitalisation rates, with higher rates observed in colder months.
	•	A moderate correlation between temperature fluctuations and hospitalisation rates, indicating the potential influence of environmental factors.
	•	Age demographics played a crucial role in hospitalisation and mortality rates, with older age groups exhibiting higher rates.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the complex interplay between environmental factors, demographic variables, and public health trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the importance of multifaceted approaches in managing and mitigating the impact of health crises.
